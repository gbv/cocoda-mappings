# Mappings from and in the GND autority files

## Sources

- Dumps at <https://data.dnb.de/opendata/> (only for selected vocabularies)
- Online-GND at <http://sru.gbv.de/ognd>  (formerly used for counting, nor working anymore because PICA `006X` is not indexed)

Additional mappings should be available from full GND dumps.
